# UWE-DigitalSystemsProject
The development, evaluation and comparison of a reinforcement learning algorithm vs, a recurrent neural network algorithm for stock trading and portfolio management.

Brief description of topic:	This project will develop and evaluate the use of different neutral-based approaches for stock trading and portfolio management. Specifically, it will initially consider two ways of framing the problem: as Reinforcement Learning (using the PPO algorithm); and as Time-Series Prediction (using a LSTM recurrent neural network).-
A comprehensive testbed will also be constructed comparing different trading conditions. This will help us analyse the performance and stability of each algorithm. We will also be using ASP.NET, an opensource web framework for .NET. This allows us to visualise the data through various techniques. Such as, a variety of graphs and profit/loss calculations. We will then contrast the evidence and see which is the highest and lowest performing algorithm in terms of profit and stability.
